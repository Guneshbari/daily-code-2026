Daily Code 2026

A year-long commitment to daily coding practice and continuous improvement.
This repository contains small, focused projects built consistently throughout 2026 to strengthen fundamentals, tooling fluency, and code quality.

The goal is consistency over perfection.

📌 Purpose

Build the habit of coding every day

Strengthen core concepts in React, JavaScript, and frontend development

Improve fluency with Git, GitHub, and Neovim through real usage

Maintain a clean, readable, and well-structured codebase

Each project represents a learning checkpoint, not a finished product.

📂 Repository Structure

Each project lives in its own folder at the root level.

📅 Commitment

At least one meaningful commit per day

Small, incremental progress is encouraged

Refactoring, cleanup, and documentation updates count

🧠 Philosophy

Show up daily.
Keep it simple.
Let consistency compound.

This repository is a learning log, not a highlight reel.

📄 Notes

node_modules are intentionally excluded

Some projects may be incomplete by design

Code quality improves over time as learning progresses
