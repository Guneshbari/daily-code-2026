# Daily Code 2026

A year-long commitment to **daily coding practice and continuous improvement**.

This repository contains small, focused React-based projects built consistently throughout 2026 to strengthen **fundamentals, tooling fluency, and code quality**.

The goal is simple:

> **Consistency over perfection.**

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Build the habit of coding every day
- Strengthen core concepts in React and JavaScript
- Improve frontend development fundamentals
- Gain real-world fluency with Git, GitHub, and Neovim (LazyVim)
- Maintain a clean, readable, and well-structured codebase

Each project represents a **learning checkpoint**, not a finished product.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each project lives in its **own folder at the root level**.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> Show up daily.  
> Keep it simple.  
> Let consistency compound.

This repository is a **learning log**, not a highlight reel.
