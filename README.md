# Daily Code 2026

A year-long commitment to daily coding practice and continuous learning.  
This repository contains small, focused projects built consistently throughout 2026 to improve problem-solving, tooling fluency, and code quality.

The goal is **consistency over perfection**.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Build the habit of coding every day
- Learn and reinforce core concepts in React, JavaScript, and tooling
- Improve comfort with Git, GitHub, and Neovim through real usage
- Maintain a clean, organized, and readable codebase

Each project represents a learning checkpoint rather than a finished product.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each project lives in its own folder at the root level.

- Refactoring, cleanup, and documentation updates count

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

> Show up daily.  
> Keep it simple.  
> Let consistency compound.

This repository is a learning log, not a highlight reel.

## 📄 Notes

- `node_modules` are intentionally excluded
- Projects may be incomplete by design
- Code quality improves over time as learning progresses
